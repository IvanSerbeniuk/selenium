## what code does:


- Imports the necessary libraries, including webdriver from Selenium, pandas, and Select from Selenium for dropdown selection.

- Initializes a Chrome WebDriver using webdriver.Chrome().

- Locates and clicks on an element on the website using an XPath selector. This element appears to be a button or checkbox labeled "All matches."

- Selects a country ("Spain") from a dropdown menu on the website.

- Locates a table with match data and extracts information about the date, home team, score, and away team for each match.

- Stores this match data in lists (date, home_team, score, and away_team).

- Creates a Pandas DataFrame using the collected data.

- Saves the DataFrame to a CSV file named "football_data.csv."
